# Geth

The `Geth` library provides functionality to interact with Geth. This includes the ability to advance rollup state, and poll and retrieve transactions from the `Geth` mempool.

Advacing the rollup state includes generating transaction payloads, transmitting them to `Geth` using the `Engine API`, and doing fork choice updates.
